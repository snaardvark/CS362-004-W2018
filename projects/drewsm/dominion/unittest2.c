 * Overview: Unit test for the fullDeckCount function in dominion.c
 *
 * Input: None
 * Output: Prints to stdout the PASS/FAIL status for each test along with 
 *          a diagnostic hint
 * 
 *  Based on the testUpdateCoins.c code template provided as part of OSU CS362
 *  
 *  Build this test with:
 *      make test2
