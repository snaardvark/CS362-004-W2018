 * Overview: random test suite for the smithyEffect function in dominion.c
 *
 * Input: None
 * Output: Prints to stdout the PASS/FAIL status for each test along with 
 *          a diagnostic hint; additional debugging information if
 *          DEBUG is set to 1 in dominion.h
 * 
 *  Build this test with:
 *      make randomtestcard1
